Forked from https://github.com/OskarSigvardsson/StopMotion-Unity

- Added delayed time instead of frame count as a boolean so both can still be used.
- Added a boolean to delay the stop motion for a bit incase the animation somehow starts playing in the end. (Happened in my [game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1701890/Heartless__Dreadful__Return_by_72_Hours/) in the loading screen. Hence why it's an option here.)
- Added an option to ignore a specific bone/object in the rig, so for example if you have an animated camera in your rig, it could be ignored.

  The license is MIT, if you got anything else to add, just shove it in there.
  Original script by Oskar is definitely one of the best solutions for quick stop motion in Unity and I am very thankful to them.
